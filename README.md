# A-Deep-Learning-Based-Plant-Disease-Classification-Using-Image-Recognition-Techniques
This project presents a modular deep learning framework for the automated and precise classification of plant diseases using images of leaves. The work addresses a critical challenge to global food security by providing a robust and reproducible system for early and accurate disease diagnosis, which is essential for effective agricultural management. Our models achieved a high overall accuracy of 94% in classifying a wide range of plant diseases
